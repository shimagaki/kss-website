### Working Experience

**Title:** Postdoc Associate  
**Institute:** Department of Computational and Systems Biology, at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine,  
**Years:** 2023 - present  
**Supervisor:** [Dr. John P. Barton](https://bartonlab.github.io/) 

My role involved quantifying the evolution of HIV, understanding HIV evolution including analytical calculations, modeling, and developing computational models.
Previously, I held the same position at the University of California, Riverside from 2021 to 2023, working under the same supervisor, Dr. Barton.

### PhD Fellow 

**Title of Thesis:** [Advanced statistical modeling and variable selection for protein sequences](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03850703/) 
**Years:** 2017 - 2021<br>
**Supervisor:** [Dr. Martin Weigt](https://sites.google.com/site/martinweigt/)<br> 
**University:** [Sorbonne Université Paris (former Université Pierre & Marie Curie)](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/sorbonne-universite-campus-pierre-et-marie-curie)<br> 
**Laboratory:** [Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr)<br>
During my PhD at Sorbonne Université Paris, I focused on the development of a protein sequence generative model and protein structure prediction. The proposed methods reduced 95% of model parameters without diminishing the generative power and contributed to improving the interpretability of the model parameters. My PhD program was supported by the prestigious [Honjo International Scholarship  Foundation](https://www.hisf.or.jp/en/scholarship/foreigner/).
