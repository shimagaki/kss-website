	Welcome to my website! I'm currently a postdoc in the Barton lab at the University of Pittsburgh, USA. I was previously a Ph.D fellow in the Weigt lab at the Sorbonne University, Paris. <br>
	I am naturally drawn to quantitative approaches, often developing algorithms based on statistical inference to explore biological systems. My research focuses on the evolution of pathogens, immune responses, and their co-evolutionary dynamics. My goal is to create predictive computational methods and frameworks that can be applied to real biological challenges, contributing to a better understanding of complex biological processes. </p>
